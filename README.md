To set up this project, `git clone` the project and install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

CSV file output for top posts, other posts, and daily top posts can be generated by running `node index.js`; files will appear in the same directory as the original `index.js`.

To output files in json instead of CSV, use `node index.js -j`.

To output files in detailed mode (including all fields, not only the id), use `node index.js -d`.

To output files in both modes (json, and with all post details), use `node index.js -dj`.
